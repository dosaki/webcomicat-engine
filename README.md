An easy solution to set up, manage and publish your webcomic!


##Dependencies
* Java
* Grails
* Tomcat


##How to install

Assuming you have Grails and Tomcat set up.

1. Clone this repository (Or [download](https://github.com/dosaki/webcomicat-engine/archive/master.zip) the source and unzip it somewhere)
2. `cd` into `webcomicat-engine`
3. Run `grails war`
4. Copy the war file into your tomcat webapps folder (I think the default is in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps`)

An installer is coming though, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/dosaki/webcomicat-engine/issues/1)

##How to configure

1. Go to <your URL>/manageComic/
2. Click "Settings" and change your configurations there.


##How do I customize?

You can't at the moment. Sorry.
