##Dependencies
* Java
* Grails
* Tomcat


##Installation

Assuming you have Grails and Tomcat set up.

1. Clone this repository (Or [download](https://github.com/dosaki/webcomicat-engine/archive/master.zip) the source and unzip it somewhere)
2. `cd` into `webcomicat-engine`
3. Run `grails war`
4. Copy the war file into your tomcat webapps folder (I think the default is in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps`)

An installer is coming though, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/dosaki/webcomicat-engine/issues/1)

##Configuration

1. Go to <your URL>/manageComic/
2. Click "Settings" and change your configurations there.


##Customization

You can't customize much at the moment. Sorry.
Support for this is [planned](https://github.com/dosaki/webcomicat-engine/issues/5) though.
